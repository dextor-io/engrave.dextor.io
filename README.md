## Instagram Post Preview MVP

This project is an MVP designed to create previews of Instagram posts, specifically for sharing quotes and personal thoughts. Users can customize the post, preview it, and download it, making it easy to share directly on Instagram.

### Features:
- **Preview Instagram Post**: Instantly preview quotes and thoughts in an Instagram-like format.
- **Download Option**: Save the generated post preview as an image to upload to Instagram.
- **Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**: Leveraging a modern tech stack for fast development and responsiveness.

### Tech Stack:
- **React + Vite**: Fast development with hot module reloading and optimized builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid styling to ensure the Instagram post preview looks polished and professional.

Currently, two official plugins are available for this setup:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
